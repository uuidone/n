# FAQ

Why does the site not update instantly?
:  The [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) build itself takes about 2 minutes to finish (beginning from installing Nix, to installing neuron, all the way to building your site). On top of that, there appears to be a lag in GitHub's actual deployment of the site. For instant deploy, keep an eye out for [Cerveau](https://neuron.zettel.page/041726b3.html).
